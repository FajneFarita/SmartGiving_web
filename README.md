## SmartGive

SmartGive is a platform that hopes to change the way charitable giving is done. Our website gives donors transparency into how their donations are spent while allowing charities to maintain their autonomy. SmartGive uses the Ethereum blockchain to make payments instant, borderless, and auditable. Charities make requests, donors pledge money to them, and merchants bid to fulfill them all on the blockchain, thus cutting out the middleman of big charities.
